# Functor Marathon Demo (Haskell)

This project is a step-by-step demonstration of **Functor** concepts in Haskell.

It covers:

- Abstracting the map function
- Defining Functor instances
- Seemingly unintuitive Functor instances
- Functor instances for Either, (,), and functions
- Using <$> operator
- Lifting functions
- Functor nesting
- Extra Functor functions from the base library
